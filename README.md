**Augmenting Publicly Available Social Determinants of Health Datasets with Clinical Data to Power Multi-Institutional Clinical Research**

# Summary

_This instructional workshop was inspired by the current approaches taken at Weill Cornell Medicine&#39;s Research Informatics team to support the clinical studies utilizing the Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) data by creating a comprehensive SDoH dataset - Variables Affecting Care and Community in New York (VACCINe). This workshop provides an introduction to augmenting clinical data with publicly available SDoH datasets to support the research enterprise at large, as well as supporting multi-institutional studies leveraging common data models such as the OMOP Common Data Model. In this workshop, we cover a brief introduction to SDoH and the current landscape of SDoH data collection methods. We will review the current approaches to obtain SDoH data from federal and local government agencies, as well as individual SDoH data. During the interactive part, the audience will learn how to merge and harmonize these publicly available datasets, recreating the VACCINe dataset on their own. We then introduce methods of geocoding for any number of the patient population. Lastly, we will demonstrate how researchers can use the OMOP Common Data Model combined with the SDoH dataset created at the workshop._

# Introduction

Social determinants of health (SDoH) constitute a broad array of environmental factors related to the circumstances in which individuals live their daily lives, including both individual-level factors, such as socioeconomic status (SES) and neighborhood social conditions, such as the availability of healthy food, local crime rates, and educational standards. The role of SDoH as a principal driver of health inequality and a substantial predictor of population health has been well-studied1,2,3. Healthcare organizations and researchers are increasingly seeking to augment their clinical data with SDoH data to improve patients&#39; health outcomes. With the advent of technology and the increasing ubiquity of the electronic health record (EHR), collecting and analyzing large volumes of patient data has become more feasible, as these data are captured during routine clinical care. However, the aggregation of similar volumes of SDoH data remains a challenge. Collecting individual SDoH variables, such as housing stability, education, and food accessibility requires the integration of data capture into clinical workflows, which poses issues both from the standpoint of resource allocation and patient comfort4. An alternate method for imputing patient SDoH data is the aggregation of neighborhood-level data through publicly available sources, under the hypothesis that patients living close to one another are likely to be subject to the same social determinants of health.

To serve the need for neighborhood-level SDoH data, federal and local government agencies have assembled several publicly available datasets aggregating SDoH measures that may have an impact on patient outcomes with varying degrees of geographic granularity. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) make available a data set aggregating the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)5 at the census-tract level for the entire United States, whereas in New York City, the Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR)6 offers a dataset that identifies all city-planted trees within the confines of the city&#39;s borders by latitude and longitude. To render these data sets useful for health services and clinical research, they must be first harmonized to a common geographic unit and then aggregated to a common data set describing each SDoH variable at the most granular level possible.

At Weill Cornell Medicine, a quarternary care center on Manhattan&#39;s Upper East Side, we have implemented a technique to geocode patient addresses derived from the electronic health record, assigning to each patient a latitude and longitude, where possible, and deriving for each the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code for their individual census block group. Utilizing the Federal Communications Commission&#39;s publicly available application processing interface (API), we extract patient addresses from the electronic health record, strip unnecessary data (such as apartment numbers), and return from the API all available geocoded data for each patient&#39;s address.

To make use of the data derived through this geocoding pipeline, we connect clinical data stored in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model7 to neighborhood-level SDoH data. Specifically, we used the techniques introduced in this workshop to develop an SDoH datasetâ€”Variables Affecting Care and Communities in NewYork (VACCINe) which has been used for several studies focusing on healthcare quality, utilization, and outcomes in Weill Cornell Medicine. VACCINe was developed by merging and harmonizing more than 5 publicly available sources and contains more than 25 variables at two different geographical units (census tract and census block group). By connecting our local instance of the OMOP common data model to VACCINe, we are able to conduct research investigating the relationship between neighborhood-level SDoH and clinical outcomes stored in the electronic health record.

# Objective

In this workshop, we aim to review the current landscape of SDoH collection methods and their strengths and limitations. Accordingly, we will review viable options to access neighborhood-level SDoH with an eye towards publicly available datasets. We will then evaluate the limitations of publicly available sources, and methods to merge and harmonize them into a comprehensive SDoH dataset to support the research enterprise. In the second portion of the workshop, we will then demonstrate techniques for connecting SDoH with clinical data, using the OMOP common data model as a standard storage technique, illustrating how researchers can use publicly-available data to examine the impact of neighborhood-level SDoH on patient-level health outcomes.

# Who Should Attend?

The expected audience for this workshop includes:

- Researchers in the field of social determinants of health
  - They will benefit from both parts of the workshop. Learning about how to create a ready-to-use SDoH dataset for research, as well as familiarize themselves with how to link the data to clinical data
- Healthcare organizations who are interested in ways to support research enterprise at large
  - Using the completed projects by Weill Cornell Medicine&#39;s Research Informatics team to geocode patients at large scale as a template, they will learn how to augment clinical data with SDoH data.
- General audience interested in learning more about available sources of SDoH data, its strengths and limitations

# Prerequisites

The workshop is a mixture of basic (40%) and intermediate (60%) material.

Prior knowledge of Social Determinants of Health and relevant topics is highly recommended, although there will be a quick overview of the basic concepts during the lecture portion of the workshop.

Familiarity with Python programming language is recommended to follow the interactive portion of the workshop. Although we will provide the code-base with all attendees.

Prior familiarity with the OMOP Common Data Model as well as experience working with EHR data for research will be useful. This will be more pertinent to the second part of this workshop.
